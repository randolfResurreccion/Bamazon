Bamazon is an Amazon-like storefront application using node and Mysql Database.
The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

*First i created a database on Mysql to hold my inventory,

*Here i created my node app that is called bamazonCustomer.
 Running this application will first display all of the items available for sale. Include the ids, names, and prices of products for sale. 
This app also prompts users with two messages:
1) ask user the ID of the product they would like to buy.
2) ask how many units of the product they would like to buy.
